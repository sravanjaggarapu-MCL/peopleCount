=========

Opening the video source and reading frames from it.

Two classes, for two different jobs:

    VideoStream          reads frames one at a time, on the calling thread.
                         Correct for FILES, where every frame matters.
    ThreadedVideoStream  reads frames in a background thread that keeps only
                         the newest one. Correct for LIVE cameras, where being
                         current matters more than seeing every frame.

Use open_stream() at the bottom to pick the right one automatically.

Why a live camera needs the threaded version
--------------------------------------------
An RTSP camera pushes frames on its own schedule and will not wait for you.
Measured on this camera: it delivers a frame every 38 ms (~25 FPS), while one
YOLO pass takes ~90 ms (~11 FPS). Read them sequentially and you consume less
than half of what arrives.

The surplus does not evaporate - it queues in FFmpeg's buffer. That queue is
bounded, so the behaviour has two stages: the lag grows until the buffer is
full, then frames start being discarded AT THE SOURCE, outside your control.
Measured by draining it, sequential reading settles about 36 frames - 1.4
seconds - behind real time, and drops frames from then on. Late video plus
missing frames is exactly what a slow consumer looks like from the outside.

The threaded reader measures 2 frames - 0.1 s - behind instead.

Note that CAP_PROP_BUFFERSIZE does not fix this. It is a hint, honoured
inconsistently across backends, and on FFmpeg/RTSP it generally is not.

The fix is to decouple the two rates. A background thread reads at the
camera's pace and keeps exactly ONE frame - the newest - overwriting whatever
was there. Inference then always starts on the most recent frame available,
and everything that arrived while it was busy is discarded rather than queued.
Dropping frames is the point: for counting people, a frame from two seconds ago
has no value, and the tracker does better with a current frame than a stale one.
