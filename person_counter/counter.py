==========

Turns tracked people into entry_count and exit_count.

The rule, stated plainly
------------------------
For each tracked person we remember the last side of the line they were seen
CLEARLY on - "clearly" meaning fully outside the dead-zone band. When they are
next seen clearly on the OTHER side, that is one crossing, and its direction
tells us whether it was an entry or an exit.

Why it is written as a confirmed-side state machine
---------------------------------------------------
The obvious implementation compares each frame's side with the previous
frame's side and counts whenever they differ. That implementation is broken,
and it breaks precisely where it matters most - at the line.

ByteTrack is resilient, but the underlying YOLO box still breathes by a few
pixels every frame: an arm swings, a leg occludes, the box edge moves, and the
foot point moves with it. A person pausing on the tripwire therefore produces a
foot point that flickers across it - left, right, left, right - and a
frame-to-frame comparison books a count for every flicker. One person standing
in a doorway can add dozens of entries.

The fix is to make the sides sticky, with a band of "no opinion" between them:

    |<-- side -1 -->|<-- dead zone -->|<-- side +1 -->|
                     no opinion here

  * Outside the band, we record the side as CONFIRMED.
  * Inside the band, we return "no opinion" and change nothing at all - the
    confirmed side simply stays whatever it last was.
  * A count happens only when a new CONFIRMED side differs from the stored one.

So jitter within the band is structurally incapable of producing a count, no
matter how violent it is. To register, a person must travel completely clear of
the band on the far side - which is exactly what walking through a doorway
does, and exactly what standing on the threshold does not.

The second guard: track age
---------------------------
A track that has existed for only a frame or two is not yet trustworthy - it
may be a flickering false positive, or a real person whose ID was just reissued
mid-stride after an occlusion. Either way its first "crossing" is an artefact.
So a track must survive MIN_TRACK_AGE_FRAMES before its crossings count. Note
that we still update its confirmed side during that time, so it starts counting
from the correct side once it has earned the right to.
