"""
line_setup.py
=============

The interactive screen where the operator drags out the counting line.

It runs on live video, so you can watch people actually walk through the scene
while you place the tripwire - far easier than guessing coordinates and far
easier than placing it on a frozen frame that happens to be empty.

Controls
--------
    click and drag   draw the line
    f                flip which side counts as ENTRY (watch the green arrow)
    r                start over
    Enter / c        confirm and begin counting
    q / Esc          cancel

A note on mouse coordinates
---------------------------
OpenCV reports mouse positions in the coordinates of the DISPLAYED image, which
is not the same thing as the frame's own pixels once a window has been scaled.
Getting this wrong puts the line somewhere other than where it was drawn, and
the error is proportional to the zoom - so it looks almost right at first
glance, which is the worst kind of bug.

Two things keep it honest here:

  * the window is WINDOW_AUTOSIZE, so its size always equals the image we hand
    it - no user resizing can introduce a scale factor behind our back;
  * we do the scaling ourselves, by a factor we chose, and divide it back out
    of every mouse coordinate.

So the line is always stored in the frame's own pixel coordinates, whatever
size the setup window happens to be.
