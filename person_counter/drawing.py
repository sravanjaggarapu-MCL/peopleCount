==========

Everything drawn on top of a frame: boxes, labels, trails and the heads-up
display. Keeping it in one module means the display loop in app.py stays about
the pipeline and not about pixel arithmetic.

A reminder that bites everyone at least once: OpenCV colours are (B, G, R),
not (R, G, B), and image coordinates put (0, 0) at the TOP-left with y growing
downwards.
