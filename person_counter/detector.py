===========

The YOLO model, in both of its modes:

    detect()  - find people in one frame, with no memory of any other frame
    track()   - find people AND give each a stable ID across frames (ByteTrack)

Why tracking is a separate thing from detection
-----------------------------------------------
Detection is memoryless: each frame is analysed from scratch, so nothing
connects the box in frame 12 to the box in frame 11. That is fine for a
headcount, but useless for entry/exit counting - to say "this person crossed
the line downwards" you must first be able to say "this person" across time.

How ByteTrack supplies that
---------------------------
Each frame it predicts where every existing track should have moved (a Kalman
filter assuming roughly constant velocity), then matches those predictions
against the new detections by box overlap (IoU).

Its namesake trick is a two-round match. Most trackers discard low-confidence
detections outright; ByteTrack does not:

    Round 1 - match existing tracks against HIGH confidence detections.
    Round 2 - take the tracks still unmatched, try them against the LOW
              confidence leftovers.

A person half-hidden behind someone else produces exactly such a weak
detection. Round 2 is what keeps their track alive through the occlusion
instead of killing it and reissuing a fresh ID - and every ID change like that
would become a double count once we are counting crossings.
