==============

The pipeline package. Importing anything from it first runs this file, which is
the one reliable place to set FFmpeg's options - see below.

Modules:
    camera.py    - opening and reading the video source
    detector.py  - YOLO detection and ByteTrack tracking
    drawing.py   - all the on-screen overlays
    app.py       - the display loop that ties them together

# FFmpeg transport setting  (MUST run before anything imports cv2)

# RTSP can carry its video over either UDP or TCP:
#
#   UDP - the default. Lost packets are gone forever, showing up as grey
#         blocks, tearing and stutter. Many corporate networks also block the
#         random high-numbered UDP ports that RTSP negotiates.
#   TCP - every packet is acknowledged and resent if lost, so the picture stays
#         clean, and it reuses the same port 554 connection that firewalls
#         already allow. Marginally higher latency, far more reliable.
#
# OpenCV exposes FFmpeg's options only through this environment variable, in
# "key;value" form (multiple options separated by "|").
#
# The placement is the subtle part: FFmpeg reads this variable when the cv2
# module loads, so setting it afterwards does nothing at all. Putting it in the
# package's __init__ guarantees it runs before any submodule can import cv2,
# because Python always executes __init__.py first. That is why the whole
# project imports OpenCV through this package rather than directly.
#
# setdefault, not assignment: if you have exported your own value in the shell,
# yours wins.
