================

The virtual tripwire: the geometry of the line, which side of it a point is on,
and how far away it is.

The maths in one paragraph
--------------------------
A line is defined by two points, A and B. For any third point P, the 2D cross
product

    cross = (B - A) x (P - A)
          = (Bx - Ax) * (Py - Ay) - (By - Ay) * (Px - Ax)

is positive on one side of the line, negative on the other, and exactly zero on
it. That sign is the whole "which side" test. Dividing by the line's length
turns the raw cross product into the perpendicular DISTANCE from the line in
pixels, which is what makes a dead zone measurable in pixels rather than in
arbitrary units.

So one number - the signed distance - answers both questions at once: its sign
says which side, its magnitude says how far. Everything else here is bookkeeping
around that.

Which side is "inside"?
-----------------------
The maths cannot know. It depends entirely on how the operator dragged the line
and where the door is. So the object carries an `entry_side` (+1 or -1) saying
which side counts as INSIDE, the setup screen draws an arrow showing it, and
the operator flips it with a keypress if it points the wrong way.
